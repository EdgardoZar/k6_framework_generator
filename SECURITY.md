# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities in the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately to avoid exposing users to potential risks.

### 2. Email Security Report
Send an email to: **security@example.com** (replace with actual security contact)

Include the following information:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)
- Your contact information

### 3. Response Timeline
- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 1 week
- **Resolution**: Within 30 days (depending on complexity)

### 4. Responsible Disclosure
We follow responsible disclosure practices:
- We will acknowledge receipt of your report
- We will investigate and validate the issue
- We will work on a fix
- We will coordinate the release of the fix
- We will credit you (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

## Security Considerations

### Input Validation
- All JSON configuration files are validated before processing
- Template variables are sanitized to prevent injection attacks
- File paths are validated to prevent directory traversal

### File System Security
- Generated frameworks are created in isolated directories
- No arbitrary file system access
- Safe file path handling

### Data Protection
- No sensitive data is logged or stored
- Configuration files should not contain secrets
- Generated frameworks are self-contained

### Dependencies
- Minimal external dependencies
- Regular security audits
- No runtime dependencies for the generator

## Best Practices

### Configuration Security
- **Never include secrets** in configuration files
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Validate all configuration inputs
- Keep configuration files in version control secure

### Generated Framework Security
- Review generated code before deployment
- Ensure API endpoints are properly secured
- Use HTTPS for production testing
- Implement proper authentication

### Development Security
- Use secure coding practices
- Regular dependency updates
- Code review for security issues
- Automated security scanning

## Security Features

### Built-in Protections
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation of all inputs
- **Path Security**: Safe file path handling and validation
- **Template Security**: Secure template variable processing
- **Error Handling**: Secure error messages without sensitive data

### Configuration Validation
- **Schema Validation**: JSON schema validation for configurations
- **Type Checking**: Strict type checking for all fields
- **Range Validation**: Validation of numeric ranges and limits
- **Format Validation**: Proper format validation for all inputs

## Vulnerability Types

### High Priority
- Remote code execution
- File system access vulnerabilities
- Template injection attacks
- Configuration injection

### Medium Priority
- Information disclosure
- Denial of service
- Input validation bypass
- Path traversal

### Low Priority
- Information leakage
- Minor input validation issues
- Documentation security issues

## Security Updates

### Automatic Updates
- Dependencies are automatically updated
- Security patches are applied promptly
- Regular security audits are performed

### Manual Updates
- Critical security fixes are released immediately
- Security advisories are published
- Users are notified of security updates

## Contact Information

For security-related questions or concerns:
- **Security Email**: security@example.com
- **General Issues**: Use GitHub issues for non-security issues
- **Discussions**: Use GitHub discussions for general questions

## Acknowledgments

We appreciate the security research community and responsible disclosure practices. Security researchers who follow responsible disclosure will be acknowledged in our security advisories.
